# Unexpected Behavior in MATLAB Function for Zero and Empty Array Inputs

This repository demonstrates a common error in MATLAB functions: unexpected behavior when handling zero and empty array inputs.  The function `myFunction` is designed to perform different operations based on the input value, but fails to handle these edge cases correctly, leading to either incorrect outputs or runtime errors.

## Bug Description

The MATLAB function `myFunction` exhibits unexpected behavior when it receives an input of 0 or an empty array ([]). The issue stems from implicit type conversion and division by zero errors.

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly checking for zero and empty array inputs and handling them appropriately to avoid errors and produce expected results.  This involves adding specific checks within the if-else block to ensure correct handling of edge cases.
